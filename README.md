The most important scripts are **"dev"**, **"start"**, **"test:watch"** and **"test"**. Use each one according to the case.

With the following script you can run the project in developer mode:
```
npm run dev
```
With the following script you can run the project starting with tests and then running the application:

```
npm run start
```

With the following script you can run the project in test mode. However, in this case every time something is changed in the test, the changes applied automatically:

```
npm run test:watch
```

With the following script you can run the project in test normal mode:
```
npm run test
```
